# Description #
This project falls within the Semantic Web study area and aims to integrate heterogeneous databases by matching properties and features obtained from products descriptions given in a natural language. The objective was to develop a mechanism for automatic identification and association (mapping) of resources (food consumer products), based on their non-normalized descriptions, to match similar products in different databases.

It's Java based and uses an ANTLR parser.
